       I like taking pictures. I am by no means a professional, but I have always wanted a DSLR. Until then, I will use my phone. I have been able to get some really good shots (in my opinion at least). I seem to gravitate to black and white, especially when for street photography. However, I think it's especially great for scenes that have a lot of flora in them. "But PJ...", you might be thinking, "isn't that so counter-intuitive? Nature is full of beautiful colors. You should capture it as is." Well, sure, I would agree with you if it weren't so...green.

      This is a rant now. The color green in nature SPECIFICALLY annoys me. It's just everywhere and honestly I can't stand it. Plus, you can get some good shots of nature in Black and White anyway. I'm not missing out. In fact...here's a picture to prove just that.

      This isn't to say that I'm opposed to all colors, though. I do like the vibrancy that they can add, but if I had to choose one theme to stick with, it would be black and white. There are obviously some things I  wouldn't desaturate, though. A black and white sunset? Heresy. A monochrome seascape? I have done this, yes, but unlike green, I don't mind a ubiquitous blue. So I'd leave those as-is. There are more things here and there, but frankly, my amateur thoughts on photography would require a blog of their own, so let's leave it here.

     <h2>Music </h2>

          I think we've moved past a point where music taste is strict. It's not uncommon for me to jump from rap to alternative or progressive metal to songs from a musical within 15 minutes. I think when it comes to music, you should just like what you like. There was a point where I fell into a lo-fi hip hop/chillhop hole, but I climbed out of that quickly. Then there was a point when I foolishly thought that popular music was somehow 'inferior' to lesser know, more underground bands and artists. (Can you spell 'pretentious hipster wannabe?) In any case, though I have matured, and so has my outlook on a lot of things, including something as small (in the grand scheme of things) as music.

          These days, because of the blurring lines of genre, it would probably be easier to list some of my favorite songs. These would include "Outliers" by Aviations, "Tornado" by Aviations, "Innocence" by Madeon, "The Killing Kind" by Mariana Trench, "Pyromance" by Indighxt, "Occupy" by Abandonded Pools and so...so many more. In fact, I could use this time to shamelessly plug myself...It is my blog after all, so I can do whatever I want. But I'd rather not because I'm kinda lazy, and there are so many playlists I could share. My point still stands, however. There's a lot of cool stuff out there. Not just as it relates to music. So try to step out of yor comfort zone. You may just like it.
